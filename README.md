# The `jsonparse` package

The `jsonparse` package provides a handy way to read in JSON data from files 
or strings in LaTeX documents, parse the data and store it in a user-defined 
token variable. The package allows accessing the stored data via a 
JavaScript-flavored syntax.

Using the commands `\JSONParseFromFile` or `\JSONParse`, JSON data can be 
stored in a token variable. Using the command `\JSONParseValue`, entries can 
be extracted from the stored data.

---

Let's assume a file with the name `example.json` is stored in the working 
directory with the following contents:

```json
{
  "givenName": "Joe",
  "familyName": "Public",
  "points": 1.7,
  "hasCertification": true,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "10 Main St",
    "locality": "Cityville",
    "postalCode": "12345"
  },
  "contactPoint": [
    {
      "contactType": "office",
      "telephone": "+1 (555) 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "contactType": "mobile",
      "telephone": "+1 (555) 555-6789"
    }
  ],
  "children": [
    "Tom",
    "Doug",
    "Harry"
  ],
  "memberOf": null
}
```

We can store it in the token variable `\myJSONdata` using the command 
`\JSONParseFromFile{\myJSONdata}{example.json}`. Calling the command 
`\JSONParseValue{\myJSONdata}{contactPoint[0].telephone}` would then result in 
the output `+1 (555) 555-1234` (indices are zero-based per default). The 
package allows for parsing JSON data inline as well.

The package also offers several commands for looping through arrays and 
accessing individual elements, for example to typeset them in tabular form or 
to plot their values using packages such as PGFPlots.

Adding commas between the items of the children array can be done with:
```tex
\JSONParseArrayUse{\myJSONdata}{children}{, }
```

A tabular listing the contact points of above JSON file can be created with:
```tex
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\textbf{Contact Type} & \textbf{Telephone} \\
\JSONParseArrayMapInline{\myJSONdata}{contactPoint}{%
  \JSONParseValue{\myJSONdata}{contactPoint[#1].contactType} & 
  \JSONParseValue{\myJSONdata}{contactPoint[#1].telephone} \\
}
\end{tabular}
```

The package also provides a few helper commands such as to validate a JSON 
number or to convert Unicode surrogate pairs to the relevant Unicode codepoint.

**Frequently asked questions**

*Why does a comparison of two equal strings return false?*

1) Note that if you probably need to use `\JSONParseExpandableValue` if you want
to compare a value from parsed JSON data with the contents of another token 
list.

2) Also note that `\JSONParseExpandableValue` returns a string with specific 
category codes, namely category code 12 (``other'') for all characters except 
spaces. Therefore, you need to test against another string. You can use 
`\detokenize` for conversion.

*Why does parsing take so long?*

1) Make sure that you use the most recent version of the package. Parsing speed
is constantly monitored and updates typically increase parsing speed.

2) If you don't need to access whole objects or arrays from the JSON data, you
can set the key `skip structures` which should increase parsing speed.

3) If the JSON data contains a considerable amount of numbers, parsing speed can 
be increased slightly by setting `validate numbers=false`.

4) If the JSON data does not change often, you can externalise the parsed result
by setting the key `externalize`.
